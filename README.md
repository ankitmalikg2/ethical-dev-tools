**Ethical Dev Tools** is a collection of essential utilities for Visual Studio Code, designed to boost your productivity and streamline your development workflow. This extension provides a Diff Checker, Base64 Encoder/Decoder, YAML Validator, JWT Tool for creating, decoding, and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), and an Epoch Tool for timestamp conversions. More tools coming soon!


## Features

### Diff Checker
Easily compare two files or text snippets with the intuitive side-by-side diff checker. Quickly identify changes and merge code with confidence.

### Base64 Encoder/Decoder
Encode and decode Base64 strings directly within VS Code. No need to switch to a browser or other tools for this common task.

### YAML Validator
Validate YAML syntax and structure instantly. Perfect for configuration files, Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests, and CI/CD pipelines. Get immediate feedback on syntax errors with detailed error messages.

### JWT Tool (Create, Decode & Verify JWT)
Create, decode, and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWT) directly in VS Code. Supports all major algorithms (HS256, RS256, ES256, and more). Instantly sign, inspect, and validate JWTs for authentication, authorization, and secure API development. Choose algorithm, input payload and secret, and get your JWT in seconds.

### Epoch Tool
Convert between Unix timestamps (epoch time) and human-readable dates effortlessly. Convert epoch timestamps to readable dates in UTC, ISO, and local formats. Convert human-readable dates back to epoch timestamps in both seconds and milliseconds. Perfect for debugging, API development, and working with time-based data.
