**Ethical Dev Tools** is a collection of essential utilities for Visual Studio Code, designed to boost your productivity and streamline your development workflow. This extension provides a side-by-side diff viewer and a Base64 encoder/decoder, with more tools to come.

## Features

### Side-by-Side Diff Viewer
Easily compare two files or text snippets with the intuitive side-by-side diff viewer. Quickly identify changes and merge code with confidence.

### Base64 Encoder/Decoder

Encode and decode Base64 strings directly within VS Code. No need to switch to a browser or other tools for this common task.
